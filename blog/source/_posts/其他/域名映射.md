## A记录
A记录又称IP指向，是用来指定主机名（或域名）对应的IP地址记录
## CNAME记录
CNAME通常称别名指向，可以为一个主机设置别名，比如设置a.domain.com.cn，用来指向一个主机www.sina.com那么以后就可以用a.domain.com.cn来代替访问www.sina.com了

## 通过man函数可以轻易的获取到以下信息
--addn-hosts=<file>
	Additional hosts file. Read the specified file as well as /etc/hosts. If -h is  given,  read  only  the  specified file.  This option may be repeated for more than one additional hosts file. If a directory is given, then read all the files contained in that directory.
--cname=<cname>,<target>
	Return a CNAME record which indicates that <cname> is really <target>. There are significant  limitations  on  the target;  it must be a DNS name which is known to dnsmasq from /etc/hosts (or additional hosts files), from DHCP or from another --cname.  If the target does not satisfy this criteria, the whole cname is ignored. The cname must be unique, but it is permissable to have more than one cname pointing to the same target.
